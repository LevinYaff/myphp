Create Own Custom Themes
========================

You can now create your own themes using Theme Generator tool present on :page: `index.php`.
Choose a Base Colour using the colour picker tool.

Colour schemes
--------------

The colour schemes are:

* Triadic
* Complementary
* Adjacent
* Monochrome

You can choose any one of the four schemes using the dropdown menu.
Each element's colour can be customised by clicking on a particular colour box.
Upon hovering the colour box it would display the element the colour corresponds to.
On clicking `Go` button the program would create the necessary theme files.
Now you can choose the theme you created from the Theme drop-down on `index.php` page.
