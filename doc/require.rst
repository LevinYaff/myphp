Requirements
============

* **PHP**

  * You need PHP 5.2.0 or newer, with ``session`` support (see
    :ref:`faq1_31`) , the Standard PHP Library (SPL) extension and JSON
    support.

  * To support uploading of ZIP files, you need the PHP ``zip`` extension.

  * For proper support of multibyte strings (eg. UTF-8, which is currently
    the default), you should install the mbstring and ctype extensions.

  * You need GD2 support in PHP to display inline thumbnails of JPEGs
    ("image/jpeg: inline") with their original aspect ratio.

  * When using the "cookie" :ref:`authentication_modes`, the `mcrypt
    <http://www.php.net/mcrypt>`_ extension is strongly suggested for most
    users and is **required** for 64â€“bit machines. Not using mcrypt will
    cause phpMyAdmin to load pages significantly slower.

  * To support upload progress bars, see :ref:`faq2_9`.

  * To support XML and Open Document Spreadsheet importing, you need PHP
    5.2.17 or newer and the `libxml <http://www.php.net/libxml>`_
    extension.

* **MySQL** 5.0 or newer (see :ref:`faq1_17`);
* **Web browser** with cookies enabled.
